### Web 3.0
web1 = Book
web2 = map
web3 = video game - Blockchain
I'm really interested in blockchain, previously I had heard of it but that's it.  After learning a little about it in class I went and got a book from the Library to read more on it.  I'm always excited to learn about new concepts that interest me so am excited to get started on the book.  The book is 'Basic Blockchain - What It Is and How It Will Transform the Way We Work and Live' by David L. Shrier.  Again it was the only one in the library on this topic at the time.  

## Agile Excersie
## *_Marshmellow Tower*_
Our team of 6 worked together to come up with a solution.  The first idea was to hang it from the ceiling - we honestly didnt hear that we couldnt do that!
So concept 2 we decided to do a triangle tower but it wasnt very stable, we didnt have enoough spaghetti or tape to truly make it stable.
It was good working as a team, getting everyone to do something for it. Everyone had input and ideas so it was fun.
The whole time i kept thinking about the self supporting impossible stool.  I kept thinking how we could use the string to get the structure to self suspend itself but i just couldnt get it to work in my brain.  i thnk this could be a good concept to work on with it.

*-Reflecting_*  After each round we reflected on what worked, what didnt and what we could improve.  It meant that each time we had to think of new ways to do it, thinking out of the box and simplifying our concept.

It's was a really fun experiment that I'd enjoy doing again.

#### Software is different to building  - Roman said a cool concept that in software you dont start at the bottom and work up as you will never get there - start at the roof/the big idea and then work from there!  Software is counter intuitive!
