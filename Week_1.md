# Week 1
Hello, World!
_Software Dev is Art, Science, Engineering and Design_
I love this concept.  I was very nervous that it would be very boring, just staring at coding and doing math.  I learn through doing, being creaive and applying to real world and imaginative ideas!

### Scratch
Scratch was fun to play around with.  My step kids, 10 and 13 use it at school.  Especially Alex (13), he's the tops of his digitech class and made a very impressive game with it.
I enjoyed using it and having fun, not worrying too much about being serious and just getting to explore ideas.  It felt a lot easier and less intimidating to be able to be creative and actually create something.

I discovered that blocks of code can be condensed down and grouped together to avoid creating a lot of clutter and a lot of repeating codes.  That was a great aspect i loved.

Here is my first Scratch.

I havent done anything else on it as yet, but my step son definatly inspired me with what he did so I'll get back in and have a play at some stage.
