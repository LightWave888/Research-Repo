## Koans

*_This week we learnt about Koans._*

Roman wanted some volunteers but I was too nervous as I feel I don't know enough.  He got the Koans set up on VS Code, I tried to follow along but it wouldnt work so I just observed.

It is a great resource to practice and learn and fix errors as you go.  I've been doing a couple each day and enjoy it. 

I retried to get it installed and got so frustrated as I just couldnt do it.  Roman cam eand howed me and got it working on my laptop so I'm able to do it at home and not have any issues with not getting it to work.  It's all about file directories, not leaving spaces in file names and so forth.  I'm starting to practice this name and changed all my repo folder names to have _ instead of spaces.

I enjoyed this week and hope to have more fun, interactive learning seesions next week
