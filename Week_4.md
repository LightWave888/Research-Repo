### Agile

*_What is Agile_*
The best catch line I read about agile is the 'Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, 
an uncertain and turbulent environment.'

From my understaning, It is a collabortive and creative approach to completeing tasks.  Where teams work together and things are continuously assesed and 
evaulated to ensure it keeps moving forward and improves each time.

I'm really like the agile concept, I feel like it takes a lot of individual pressure of people but still allows for creative input and allows for shyer people 
or people who maybe don't feel confident about an idea to still be able to have input.  A scroll through jobs on seek, the majority are also asking for experience 
or familiar with agile environments.

As well as reading up on agile online I've also got a book from the library to read through. 'Improving Agile Teams - Using Constraints to Unlock Creativity' by Paul Goddard 
It was the only book in stock at the library on Agile, but I'll see what I can get from it.

### Recording train
The project was to Record a subject; sbuject leaves frame; cut and stop filming
Film someone until they leave the frame then say cut.  Everyone should stop recording when first person says cut.  Then place all phones on floor in a row 
and play them all at once.  Record them all playing at once in a line with another phone.

Most people in the group weren't too sure what to do or perhaps wanting to do it, no one could really get organised to do it togehter.  I suggested to Roman 
someone needs to count down and he suggested i just do it  - i'm pretty shy to speak up in class, so i wasnt that comfortable to do it initially but i just 
did and yelled out ill count down to 3 and start to try and get it all working together.  I filmed a lady that hid behind a planter, i yelled cut and everyone stopped.
*We went back upstairs, laid down the phone and Roman recorded them

### Reflective Questions:

I felt fine doing the experiment itself.  The only thing i felt a bit wierd was the lack of someone directing the actual activity and then having to speak up 
myself to get everyone to start.  I'm getting better at this but it does take my time to feel comfortable with a group.  Some people werent sure what to do.
