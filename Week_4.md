### Agile

*_What is Agile_*
The best catch line I read about agile is the 'Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, 
an uncertain and turbulent environment.'

From my understaning, It is a collabortive and creative approach to completeing tasks.  Where teams work together and things are continuously assesed and 
evaulated to ensure it keeps moving forward and improves each time.

I'm really like the agile concept, I feel like it takes a lot of individual pressure of people but still allows for creative input and allows for shyer people 
or people who maybe don't feel confident about an idea to still be able to have input.  A scroll through jobs on seek, the majority are also asking for experience 
or familiar with agile environments.

As well as reading up on agile online I've also got a book from the library to read through. 'Improving Agile Teams - Using Constraints to Unlock Creativity' by Paul Goddard 
It was the only book in stock at the library on Agile, but I'll see what I can get from it.
