# Git and Git Hub

### Github
*_What is Github?_*

After experiencing Github, I would describe it as an online code diary and sharing platform.  People can write and store codes, share ideas, and collaborate on ideas with coding as well.  A great function is that it keeps track of everything, so if you are writing and storing your code in here you can at any time go back and see a particular part.  This is very useful if your code breaks and you need to go back to where it was working fine - If you sotred it in Github you can easily find that part!  It is also useful if you are working on a project with other people as you can all work on it.  You can fork projects and make projects public or private.
I also found that you can link VS Code to Github so it will automatically pull it to a Github repository.  I'm still working this out though as i didnt do it correctly and had issues with my VS code.  I'll try getting that set up again soon.

Learning Github at first was very odd.  I couldnt understand the point of it.  Maybe because I never kept a diary when i was younger so i struggled to see the reason for it.  I didnt do much on it for the first few weeks.  I'm getting use to coming in here and writing my ideas and as i gain more skills i'll be adding more in here!  As i get more comfortable and get to practise more code i'll be storing them in here too!

Git is the actual software that stores your code.  Users can work together on the code and track changes.
