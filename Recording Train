# Recording train
The project was to Record a subject; sbuject leaves frame; cut and stop filming Film someone until they leave the frame then say cut. Everyone should stop recording when first person says cut. Then place all phones on floor in a row and play them all at once. Record them all playing at once in a line with another phone.

Most people in the group weren't too sure what to do or perhaps wanting to do it, no one could really get organised to do it togehter. I suggested to Roman someone needs to count down and he suggested i just do it - i'm pretty shy to speak up in class, so i wasnt that comfortable to do it initially but i just did and yelled out ill count down to 3 and start to try and get it all working together. I filmed a lady that hid behind a planter, i yelled cut and everyone stopped. *We went back upstairs, laid down the phone and Roman recorded them

# Reflective Questions:
I felt fine doing the experiment itself. The only thing i felt a bit wierd was the lack of someone directing the actual activity and then having to speak up myself. I'm getting better at this but it dones take my time to feel comfortable with a group. Some people werent sure what to do. 22/08/2022
