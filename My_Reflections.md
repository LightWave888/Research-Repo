## Study
Feeling like im not able to study enough, can't get in the zone and havent been keeping up with reading and exercises. Once i get home and the kids get home i 
get too distracted and of course the kids need things.  I'm going to start going to the library to make some more time to be alone and quiet to get more focus.


## Agile Learning and our Project
I have a lot of ideas, all ideas I want to create in the real world.  Trying to work out what to do for my project - my main block is a) what can i get across 
as a prototype or idea easily?   b) what medium will I use to mock up my idea?  c) How do i ensure my idea is protected?
My last concern encourages me to do something that i dont actually want to make, but I cant really come up with any ideas that I dont think would be great in 
the real world.
Afer having ideas directly copied and used by others without any acknowledgment in the past (in different industries) I'm very cautious and very protective with 
my ideas now.  The Social Network movie exposed how Mark Zuch stole FB, and I'm sure it happens at lot in this industry.

## Programs
I feel like theres a lot of programs out there that i don't know about, i feel a bit lost and getting confused.  Whats the next step?  I want to learn and be introduced to new programs to play around with.  I can't learn by reading pages and pages of content, I need to do, see and try.


## My Software Project
Finally - I've decided on my project.  It's a huge concept though! 
Soemthing that I think would be really cool, I'm consulting with my 13year step son to get an idea of what him and his peers find interesting, attention grabbing, fun and rewarding.

## VS Code
*_I keep having issues with VS Code_*
Found out I shouldnt just push the PLAY button and actually push the drop down instead.  Then found out can click in the terminal, push and enter.  Even easier! Working well now!

## Starting to use Github more
I feel like i'm finally getting in the flow a bit of using this tool.  Have created a number of repositories with all my ideas, and feel like just getting them into here is going to help get them into reality!
