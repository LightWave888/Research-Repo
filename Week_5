### Recording Train
### Recording train
The project was to Record a subject; sbuject leaves frame; cut and stop filming
Film someone until they leave the frame then say cut.  Everyone should stop recording when first person says cut.  Then place all phones on floor in a row 
and play them all at once.  Record them all playing at once in a line with another phone.

Most people in the group weren't too sure what to do or perhaps wanting to do it, no one could really get organised to do it togehter.  I suggested to Roman 
someone needs to count down and he suggested i just do it  - i'm pretty shy to speak up in class, so i wasnt that comfortable to do it initially but i just 
did and yelled out ill count down to 3 and start to try and get it all working together.  I filmed a lady that hid behind a planter, i yelled cut and everyone stopped.
*We went back upstairs, laid down the phone and Roman recorded them

(Tiktok uses the users previous likes as an algorythm)
### Reflective Questions:

I felt fine doing the experiment itself.  The only thing i felt a bit wierd was the lack of someone directing the actual activity and then having to speak up 
myself to get everyone to start.  I'm getting better at this but it does take my time to feel comfortable with a group.  Some people werent sure what to do.

## Study
Feeling like im not able to study enough, can't get in the zone and havent been keeping up with reading and exercises. Once i get home and the kids get home i 
get too distracted and of course the kids need things.  I'm going to start going to the library to make some more time to be alone and quiet to get more focus.


## Agile Learning and our Project
I have a lot of ideas, all ideas I want to create in the real world.  Trying to work out what to do for my project - my main block is a) what can i get across 
as a prototype or idea easily?   b) what medium will I use to mock up my idea?  c) How do i ensure my idea is protected?
My last concern encourages me to do something that i dont actually want to make, but I cant really come up with any ideas that I dont think would be great in 
the real world.
Afer having ideas directly copied and used by others without any acknowledgment in the past (in different industries) I'm very cautious and very protective with 
my ideas now.  The Social Network movie exposed how Mark Zuch stole FB, and I'm sure it happens at lot in this industry.

## Programs
I feel like theres a lot of programs out there that i don't know about, i feel a bit lost and getting confused.  Whats the next step?  I want to learn and be introduced to new programs to play around with.  I can't learn by reading pages and pages of content, I need to do, see and try.


## My Software Project
Finally - I've decided on my project.  It's a huge concept though! 
Soemthing that I think would be really cool, I'm consulting with my 13year step son to get an idea of what him and his peers find interesting, attention grabbing, fun and rewarding.

## VS Code
*_I keep having issues with VS Code_*
Found out I shouldnt just push the PLAY button and actually push the drop down instead.  Working well now!

## Blockchain
### Web 3.0
web1 = Book
web2 = map
web3 = video game - Blockchain
I'm really interested in blockchain, previously I had heard of it but that's it.  After learning a little about it in class I went and got a book from the Library to read more on it.  I'm always excited to learn about new concepts that interest me so am excited to get started on the book.

## Agile Excersie
## *_Marshmellow Tower*_
Our team of 6 worked together to come up with a solution.  The first idea was to hang it from the ceiling - we honestly didnt hear that we couldnt do that!
So concept 2 we decided to do a triangle tower but it wasnt very stable, we didnt have enoough spaghetti or tape to truly make it stable.
It was good working as a team, getting everyone to do something for it. Everyone had input and ideas so it was fun.
The whole time i kept thinking about the self supporting impossible stool.  I kept thinking how we could use the string to get the structure to self suspend itself but i just couldnt get it to work in my brain.  i thnk this could be a good concept to work on with it.

*-Reflecting_*  After each round we reflected on what worked, what didnt and what we could improve.  It meant that each time we had to think of new ways to do it, thinking out of the box and simplifying our concept.

It's was a really fun experiment that I'd enjoy doing again.

#### Software is different to building  - Roman said a cool concept that in software you dont start at the bottom and work up as you will never get there - start at the roof/the big idea and then work from there!  Software is counter intuitive!

### Starting to use Github more
I feel like i'm finally getting in the flow a bit of using this tool.  Have created a number of repositories with all my ideas, and feel like just getting them into here is going to help get them into reality!
