Recording train
*Record a subject; sbuject leaves frame; cut and stop filming
Film someone until they leave the frame then say cut.  Everyone should stop recording when first person says cut.  Then place all phones on floor in a row and play them all at once.  Record them all playing at once in a line with another phone.

Most people in the group didnt follow instructions, no one could really get organised to do it togehter.  I sais ill count down to 3 and start to try and get it all working together.  I filmed a lady that hid behind a planter, i yelled cut and everyone stopped.

We went back upstairs, laid down the phone and Roman recorded them

Tiktok uses users previous likes as an algorythm

### Reflective Questions:


I felt fine doing the experiment itself.  The only thing i felt a bit wierd was the lack of someone directing the actual activity.  Some people werent sure wjhat to do, the activity needed a director.  I thought this group wouldnt do well on a lost island etc.  LOL
