## Software-Devs-Art-Experiment

Recording train
*Record a subject; sbuject leaves frame; cut and stop filming
Film someone until they leave the frame then say cut.  Everyone should stop recording when first person says cut.  Then place all phones on floor in a row and play them all at once.  Record them all playing at once in a line with another phone.

Most people in the group didnt follow instructions, no one could really get organised to do it togehter.  I sais ill count down to 3 and start to try and get it all working together.  I filmed a lady that hid behind a planter, i yelled cut and everyone stopped.

We went back upstairs, laid down the phone and Roman recorded them

Tiktok uses users previous likes as an algorythm

### Reflective Questions:


I felt fine doing the experiment itself.  The only thing i felt a bit wierd was the lack of someone directing the actual activity.  Some people werent sure wjhat to do, the activity needed a director.  I thought this group wouldnt do well on a lost island etc.  LOL

## IT
Feeling like im not able to study enough, can't get in the zone and havent been keeping up with reading and exercises.


## Agile Learning and our Project
I have a lot of ideas, all ideas I want to create in the real world.  Trying to work out what to do for my project - my main block is a) what can i get across as a prototype or idea easily b) what medium will I use to mock up my idea?  c) how do i ensure my idea is protected.
c) concern encourages me to do something that i dont actually want to make, but i cant really come up with any ideas that i dont think would be great in the real world.
Afer having ideas directly copied and used in the past I'm very cautious and very protective and secretive with my ideas now.

## Programs
I feel like theres a lot of programs out there that i don't know about, i feel a bit lost and getting confused.  Whats the next step?  I want to learn and be introduced to new programs to play around with.  I can't learn by reading pages and pagesa of content, i need to do, see, try.


# My Software Project
Finally - I've decided on my project.  It's a huge concept though! 

# Web 3.0
web1 = Book
